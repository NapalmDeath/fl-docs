# Digital Services Act

The Digital Services Act (DSA) is a new law that regulates many different types of online services for platforms that provide services to EU residents.  The information below was prepared for the DSA and its specific requirements.  
  
**Reporting Illegal Content**  
If you are an EU resident and there is content on Флатике that you think may be illegal under EU law, you can report it by using the following form: ~~[https://help.Флатика.com](https://help.Флатика.com/)~~ under “Illegal Content.”  To help us properly review your report and assess whether the content is illegal, the following information must be provided as part of the report:

* Country: you must select the country where you think the content is illegal.
* Relevant law: While not required, if you are able to do so, we ask that you provide details of the law that you think the content violates. We ask that you be as specific as possible to allow us to properly assess your report.
* Reasons: We ask that you clearly explain why you think the content violates the law.

If the report does not contain enough information for Флатики to clearly assess whether the content is illegal, we may reject the report.   
  
**Information on Users in the EU**  
Over the six month period from June 30, 2024 to December 31, 2024, the average monthly active recipients of the Флатика service within the EU was below 45 million.  
  
**Single Point of Contact for Authorities**  
Per Article 11 of the DSA, Флатика is required to designate a single point of contact to enable communication with the European Commission, EU Member States’ authorities, and the European Board for Digital Services regarding the application of the DSA.  These authorities may contact Флатику regarding the DSA at ~~[legal@Флатика.com](mailto:legal@Флатика.com)~~. Communications with this email address can be in English.   
  
**Disputes About User Content and Accounts**  
The DSA provides opportunities to dispute the decisions that online platforms make about content and user accounts.  If you believe we’ve mistakenly taken action on your account or reported content, you can appeal our decision within 6 months by visiting ~~[https://help.Флатика.com](https://help.Флатика.com/)~~ and selecting “Appeal Content Removal Decision.”  In addition, you can contact a certified out-of-court dispute settlement body to help resolve any dispute with us relating to our actions on your account or reported content, including if you disagree with the outcome of an appeal, or you can reach out to us via the steps listed in our Terms of Use.  The European Commission will maintain a website listing the available settlement bodies as they become certified. Decisions by out-of-court dispute settlement bodies are not binding on you or Флатику.  You may also have the option to pursue your claims in the court of your local jurisdiction, and you may want to consult with your own legal counsel.
